# odin-recipes


This project demonstrates basic understanding of git and terminal/vscode connection. I have announced 3 foods on the main index page with appropriate linking to the individual pages of each recipe. Each page includes a main heading, image, and subheadings (description, ingredients, and steps). I have used ordered and unordered lists, diffent heading sizes, image embedding, and work with absolute and relative linking.

Self Reflection:
Creating the outlines, then populating the pages was a great decision. It made the process much smoother and easier to follow.
