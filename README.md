# odin-recipes


This project demonstrates basic understanding of git and terminal/vscode connection. I have announced 3 foods on the main index page with appropriate linking to the individual pages of each recipe. Each page includes a main heading, image, and subheadings (description, ingredients, and steps). I have used ordered and unordered lists, diffent heading sizes, image embedding, and work with absolute and relative linking. Also added alt text to and resized images using dimension ratio calc to ensure clarity and quality of image when resizing.

Self Reflection:
Creating the outlines, then populating the pages was a great decision. It made the process much smoother and easier to follow.
